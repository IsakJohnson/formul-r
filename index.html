            <h2>1. Life and Accomplishments</h2>
            <p>
                Jesus led a life of compassion and purity, serving as a moral guide. According to *Surah Al-Imran (3:49)* and *Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:110)* in the Quran, he performed miracles, including creating a bird from clay and giving it life by God's permission—a unique act. These verses emphasize that such creation is only possible by God, reinforcing monotheism in Islam, while Jesus' actions exemplify his extraordinary role as a prophet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the prophecy in *Isaiah 53*, written centuries before his birth, foretells the suffering servant who would bear the sins of many. This prophecy, indicating the coming of the Messiah, highlights the divine plan that aligns with Jesus' mission on Earth.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Influence Across Cultures</h2>
            <p>
                Revered in Christianity and Islam, Jesus, known as Isa, unites faiths in common values of peace, humility, and divine purpose. His unique role in both scriptures promotes understanding and respect between faiths. The Quran affirms that Jesus will return (Surah Al-Zukhruf 43:61), further solidifying his significance in Islamic eschatology.
